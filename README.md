# Rails: The HTS Experiment

This is the code repository for a simple Event tracking [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
application implemented in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) with
[Hotwire, Turbo and Stimulus](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/). It was forked from
James Hibbard's excellent [Rails/React tutorial](https://hibbard.eu/rails-react-crud-app/).

See the rationale for this experiment on our [blog](https://teamgaslight.com/blog/Rails-The-HTS-Experiment).

The following repo branches are of interest:
* [fork-point](https://github.com/gaslight/hts-experiment/tree/fork-point):
where this repo was forked from the upstream repo
* [react-current](https://github.com/gaslight/hts-experiment/tree/react-current):
the upgraded React implementation
* [rails-non-hts](https://github.com/gaslight/hts-experiment/tree/rails-non-hts):
the "vanilla" (non-HTS) Rails implementation

Eventually, this branch will contain the completed HTS implementation:
* [rails-with-hts](https://github.com/gaslight/hts-experiment/tree/rails-with-hts):
the Rails version implemented with Hotware, Turbo and Stimulus
